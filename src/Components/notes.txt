Notes:

Goals vs Habits...

Goal - an aim or a desired result
Habit - something that a person does often in a regular and 
repeated way

Obviously there's a relationship between the two, the goal is
the objective, milestone, etc. something that is achieved (or not) in
an instance in time - it has the nature of a snapshot. A habit on
the other hand, is something that is ongoing and can be tied to a 
specific goal in that a person may think "if I successfully"
implement X habit I can achieve Y goal.
